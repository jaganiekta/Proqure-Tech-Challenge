When any of those buttons is clicked, they need to log their index in the console.

Use only Javascript and not JQuery if you can.

## Exercise 4

Modify the code so that when a user clicks on the "Load Todos" button, it loads the list of todo items from an API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos) and displays the first 10 of them in a HTML table. The columns in the table should show all 4 properties returned by the API.
